- Insert is_game_over() into either buy or some get() function

- potentially use decorators to intercept history? idk...
def try_all_cards(): or something
hm....but some of the api functions alter the playing field.
yeesh
I feel like we just gotta save the fun version and then rewrite 
for all possibilities

- would be nice to be able to use the API just to simulate a game,
but there's a big difference between choosing a choice randomly,
choosing a choice tactically based on some AI, and checking every
choice...

- do a "release" branch.
